    <p translate-html="page.projects.section.crypt-of-the-csharpdancer.desc">This was a small project I made during my first year at the IUT de Dijon. The goal was to make a little artificial intelligence to play the game. The game was a server and my AI was a client. Then, as I finished it sooner than expected, I made a server myself, adding moving monsters to the game, making it a little more complex.</p>
