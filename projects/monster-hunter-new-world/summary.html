    <p translate-html="page.projects.section.monster-hunter-new-world.desc-lite">This was a small project I made with 3 other persons during my first year at the IUT de Dijon. The goal was to make a little game on a command prompt with FreePascal. I made all the user interface part with its logic while my teammates made all the logic stuff and I love the final result a lot.</p>
