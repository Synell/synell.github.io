    <p translate-html="page.projects.section.plants-vs-zombies.desc-lite">The goal of this project was to make a little 2D game with WPF and a basic game engine by the IUT de Dijon. I made all the engine and scene stuff, and a big part of the UI. For the sprites, we used the textures from the original game and made the pattern texture animations. The rest of my team made the level system, and most of the game logic.</p>
