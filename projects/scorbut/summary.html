    <p translate-html="page.projects.section.scorbut.desc-lite">This was a small project I made with 3 other persons during my second year at the IUT de Dijon. The goal was to make a website by following specifications given by a "client". Scorbut is a web application allowing users to earn trophies and points, in order to motivate them to contribute and participate in events or to push them to carry out actions within their student life.</p>
