                <h3>Scratch</h3>
                <p translate-html="page.resume.section.history.scratch.desc">I've started learning programming with Scratch, by doing some little games.</p>

                <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                <p translate-html="page.resume.section.history.minecraft.desc">Then, I discovered Minecraft, and its potencial to create interactive stuff with command blocks, and then later, datapacks. Command blocks and datapacks are using a built-in custom language that allows map makers to code custom interactions with the game.</p>

                <div class="spacing"></div>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p translate-html="page.resume.section.history.python.desc">Then, I discovered Python. I loved it because it's beginner friendly, while doing very complex stuff. It's pretty good at everything like making web backend (e.g. Flask), building desktop applications (e.g. PyQt, PySide), analysing data and making artificial intelligence (e.g. Panda, OpenCV), etc. Because it's an interpreted language, it's slower than compiled languages. However, it allows easy merge with other languages like C++ so it become very good for doing most of the complex work, while the really time consuming stuff is written in C++. It's a well balanced language in my opinion.</p>

                    <p translate-html="page.resume.section.profile-picture.desc">As a big fan of Splatoon, I wanted to draw a profile picture that would represent an octoling. I first decided to draw the head with long hair as I quite don't like the short hair cups available in the game. Because the head was looking super good, I thought it would be cool to draw the whole body. So I did. I'm pretty happy with the result. :)<br/><br/>Of course, my profile picture only takes a small part of the whole drawing, as a profile picture is pretty small, so I kept the best part of it, that means the head with her left hand.<br/><br/>This drawing is far from being finished: the whole body is done, and I'm currently drawing the weapon on which her right hand rests, a Ballpoint Splatling. Then, I'll draw the background elements. Currently, the idea is that she's smiling, while preparing for a turf war match, in the locker room.</p>
